# QCM
QCM means Questionnaires Ã  Choix Multiple (English: Multiple Choice Questionnaires).
This project is about creating nodeJS application for parents to make their children work based on questions/answers.
What I want to do is exercises that can be modified easily by the parents (json files).
Next steps will be to add a database, and parents will be able to submit their exercises.
